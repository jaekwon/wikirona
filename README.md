# Intro

Wikirona Repository (COVID19)\
by People, for People.\
[Join us now, why wait longer?](https://join.slack.com/t/wikirona/shared_invite/zt-creubqis-YN31P7ioJb7PEZ0rOs8MhQ).

This repository is meant to host things like:

 * extra-ordinary claims with extra-ordinary proofs about COVID19
   - extent of local epidemics
   - prognosis and (case) fatality rate
   - mitigation
   - and more
 * (bio)informatic problems
 * (DIY?) masks
 * (DIY?) tests
 * (DIY?) ventilators
 * education material
 * preparation ideas
 * protocols and proposals

_To save the most lives, we should see that this message spreads faster than the disease._

# Mission

Our shared goal is ultimately to reduce deaths and suffering.

0. **Help people get the truth.**
   * Prove pandemic projections.
   * Prove case fatality projections.
   * Link to medical communities for vaccine/medical information.
     - Disclosure: we are not the medical professionals.
     - Disclosure: we see conflicting information.
   * See [/claims](/claims/README.md).
1. **Help people not get sick.**
   * Help people to go out less.
     1.  [Letter to Employer](https://github.com/wikirona/wikirona/blob/master/resources/work/letter_to_employer.md) - Let anyone communicate decision to stay home to employer.

   * Tools to improve international collaborations of clinical trials

   * Crowdsourcing of relevant bionformatic problems.
     * See [/bioinformatics](/bioinformatics/README.md).
4. **Help techincal knowledge sharing**
   * Incentivize governments and corporations to openly distribute relevant technical documents.
     * Organize petitions and open letters.
   * Create a repository for shared technical documents.  
5. **Help enforcement of isolation policies**
   * Isolation and mobility restrictions are currently one of the most effective repsonses. People need to be authorized in order to perform necessary activities and checks need to put in place to verify that people comply with authorized activities.

## TODO

We need to find more communities for:

1. producing (and deploying) Sanitizers.
1. producing Masks.
1. producing Tests.
1. providing Oxygen.
1. allocating Beds.
1. allocating Food and Basic Necessities.
     
# Priorities for this Project

1. **Website** - The repo should be able to host it self and be auditable, based on SQL.
2. **Censorship-proof datastore integration** - e.g. blockchain backend for messages.
3. **Update Directories** - Find the best way to present a directory of *all* COVID19 information.
